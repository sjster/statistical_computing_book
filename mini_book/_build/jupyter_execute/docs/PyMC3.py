### What is PyMC3?

PyMC3 is a probabilistic programming framework for performing Bayesian modeling and visualization. It uses Theano as a backend. It has algorithms to perform Monte Carlo simulation as well as Variational Inference. 

It can be used to infer values of parameters of model equations that we are unsure about by utilizing the observed data. A good example is given here [https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/ODE_API_introduction.html](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/ODE_API_introduction.html). We are trying to estimate the parameters of air resistance from the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) of freefall. We have an understanding of the physics behind freefall as represented by the ODE and we have observed/measured some variables but we don't know what the parameter of air resistance is here. We can use PyMC3 to perform inference and give us a distribution of potential values of air resistance. A key point to note here is that the more information we have regarding other variables, the more certainty we have in our desired variable (air resistance). Suppose we are unsure about the gravitational constant used in the ODE (implemented by specifying a prior distribution as opposed to a constant value of 9.8), we get more uncertainty in the air resistance variable as well.

We will look at an example of Linear Regression to illustrate the fundamental features of PyMC3.

### General Structure of PyMC3

It consists of phenomena represented by equations made up of Random Variables and Deterministic variables. The random variables can be divided into Observed variables and Unobserved variables. The observed variables are those for which we have data and the unobserved variables are those for which we have specify a prior distribution.

#### Observed Variables

```
with pm.Model():
    obs = pm.Normal('x', mu=0, sd=1, observed=np.random.randn(100))
```

#### Unobserved Variables

```
with pm.Model():
    x = pm.Normal('x', mu=0, sd=1)
```

#### HDI, HPD and ROPE

HDI, HPD and ROPE are essentially used for making decisions from the posterior distribution.
We will plot the posterior of the beta distribution with the set parameters and a credible interval for the Highest-Posterior Density (HPD) which is the interval that has the given probability indicated by the HPD. What is the probability of getting a value given by x? We can't really calculate this exactly but we can compute this probability within a range given by x + $\Delta$x, x - $\Delta$x. A related term is the Highest Density Interval (HDI) which is a more general term that can apply for any distribution such as a prior. In other words a posterior's HDI is called the HPD. 

As an example, if we suspect that the dice used at a casino is loaded, we can infer the probability of getting the value 3 from the six possible outcomes. Ideally, this should be 1/6 = 0.16666. If this happens to fall in the HPD, we can assume that the dice is fair however it may be that the distribution may be biased to one side or the other.  

Sometimes, instead of looking at the probability that x = 0.16666, we look at the probability that it falls within the range 0.12 and 0.20 called the Region of Practical Equivalence or ROPE. This implies that, based on our subjective opinion, getting a value between 0.12 and 0.20 is practically equivalent to getting a 0.16666 or that we can assume that the dice is fair given any value within this range. ROPE allows us to make inferences about an event. After computing the posterior our ROPE given by 0.12 and 0.20 can either overlap with the HPD from the posterior density of getting a 3 

* completely
* not overlap at all 
* partially overlap with the HPD

Complete overlap suggests that our computed probability coincides with what we would expect from a fair dice. If it does not overlap, it is not a fair dice and a partial overlap indicates that we cannot be certain that is either fair or unfair.

In short, we define a ROPE based on our subject matter expertise and compare it to the HPD to make a decision from the posterior distribution.

##### Credible intervals vs. Confidence Intervals

This deserves special mention particularly due to the subtle differences stemming from the Bayesian (credible intervals) vs. Frequentist (confidence intervals) approaches involved. Bayesian's consider the parameters to be a distribution and that there is no true parameter however Frequentists assume that there exists a true parameter. 
* Confidence intervals quantify our confidence that the true parameter exists in this interval. It is a statement about the interval. 
* Credible intervals quantify our uncertainty about the parameters since there are no true parameters in a Bayesian setting. It is a statement about the probability of the parameter.

For e.g. if we are trying to estimate the R0 for COVID-19, one could say that we have a 95% confidence interval of the true R0 being between 2.0 and 3.2. In a Bayesian setting, the 95% credible interval of (2,3.2) implies that we are 95% certain that 

We will see how we can visualize these metrics using ArViz. 

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats as stats 

np.random.seed(1)

az.plot_posterior({'θ':stats.beta.rvs(5, 5, size=20000)},
                  #credible_interval=0.75,                    # defaults to 94%
                  hdi_prob = 0.85,                            # credible_interval is deprecated, use hdi_prob
                  rope =[0.45, 0.55])

Another way to do this is by plotting a reference value on the posterior. Below, a reference value of 0.48 is used and it can be seen that 45.2% of the posterior is below this value while 54.8% of the posterior is above this value. If we were estimating our parameter to have a value of 0.48, this suggests a good fit but with a slight right bias or in other words that the parameter is likely to have a value greater than 0.48.

az.plot_posterior({'θ':stats.beta.rvs(5, 5, size=20000)},
                  #credible_interval=0.75,                    # defaults to 94%
                  hdi_prob = 0.85,                            # credible_interval is deprecated, use hdi_prob
                  ref_val=0.48)

### Modeling with a Gaussian distribution

Gaussians (Normal distributions) are normally used to approximate a lot of practical data distributions. One reason for this is the Central Limit Theorem, which states: 

**The distribution of the sample means will be a normal distribution**

[Intuitive explanation of the Central Limit Theorem](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/central-limit-theorem/)

which implies that if we take the mean of the sample means, we should get the true population mean. There is also a more subtle reason for adopting the Gaussian distribution to represent a lot of phenomena; a lot of them are a result of averages of varying factors. 

The other reason is the mathematical tractability of the distribution, it is easy to compute in closed form. While not every distribution can be approximated with a single Gaussian distributions, we can use a mixture of Gaussians to represent other multi-modal distributions.

The probability density for a Normal distribution in a single dimension is given by:

$P(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / 2 \sigma^2}$

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. In higher dimensions, we have a vector of means and covariance matrix. 

#### Example with PyMC3

We read the chemical shifts data, and plot the density to get an idea of 
the data distribution. It looks somewhat like a Gaussian so maybe we can start
there. We have two parameters that is the mean and the standard deviation. 
We can estimate a prior for the mean by looking at the density and putting 
some bounds using a uniform prior. The standard deviation is however chosen to 
have a mean-centered half-normal prior - half-normal since the standard deviation 
cannot be negative. We can provide a hyperparameter for this by insoecting the
density again. These values decide how well we converge to a solution so good 
values are essential for good results. 

##### Note on scalablility 
If your trace information is too big as a result of too many variables or the model being large, you do not want to store this in memory since it can overrun the machine memory. Persisting this in a DB will allow you to reload it and inspect it at a later time as well. For each run, it appends the samples to the DB (or file if not deleted).

data = np.loadtxt('chemical_shifts.csv')
az.plot_kde(data, rug=True)
plt.yticks([0], alpha=0)

data

import pymc3 as pm
from pymc3.backends import SQLite, Text
model_g = Model()

with model_g:
    
    #backend = SQLite('test.sqlite')
    db = pm.backends.Text('test')
    μ = pm.Uniform('μ', lower=40, upper=70)
    σ = pm.HalfNormal('σ', sd=10)
    y = pm.Normal('y', mu=μ, sd=σ, observed=data)
    trace_g = pm.sample(draws=1000) # backend = SQLite('test.sqlite') - Does not work

az.plot_trace(trace_g)
pm.model_to_graphviz(model_g)    

help(pm.backends)

from pymc3.backends.sqlite import load

with model_g:
    #trace = pm.backends.text.load('./mcmc')
    trace = pm.backends.sqlite.load('./mcmc.sqlite')
    
print(len(trace['μ']))

Use a pairplot of the parameters to ensure that there are no correlations that would adversely affect the sampling process.

az.plot_pair(trace_g, kind='kde', fill_last=False)

az.summary(trace_g)

#### Posterior predictive check

We can draw samples from the inferred posterior distribution to check to see how they line up with the observed values. Below, we draw 100 samples of length corresponding to that of the data from this posterior. You are returned a dictionary for each of the observed variables in the model. You can also plot the distribution of these samples by passing this variable 'y_pred_g' as shown below. Setting mean=True in the call to plot_ppc computes the mean distribution of the 100 sampled distributions and plots it as well.

Two things can be noted here, the mean distribution of the samples from the posterior predictive distribution is close to the distribution of the observed data but the mean of this mean distribution is slightly shifted to the right. Also, the variance of the samples; whether we can say qualitatively that this is acceptable or not depends on the problem. In general, the more representative data points available to us, the lower the variance.

Another thing to note here is that we modeled this problem using a Gaussian distribution, however we have some outliers that need to be accounted for which we cannot do well with a Gaussian distribution. We will see below how we can use a Student's t-distribution for that.

y_pred_g = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace_g, 100, model_g)
print("Shape of the sampled variable y and data ",np.shape(y_pred_g['y']), len(data))

y_pred_g['y'][0]

data_ppc = az.from_pymc3(trace=trace_g, posterior_predictive=y_pred_g)
ax = az.plot_ppc(data_ppc, figsize=(12, 6), mean=True)
ax[0].legend(fontsize=15)

### Robust models with a Student's t distribution

As mentioned in the previous section, one of the issues with assuming a Gaussian distribution is the assumption of finite variance. When you have observed data that lies outside this 'boundary', a Gaussian distribution is not a good fit and PyMC3 and other MCMC-based tools will be unable to reconcile these differences appropriately.

The probability density function is given by:

$P(t) = \dfrac{\gamma ((v+1) / 2)}{\sqrt{v \pi} \gamma (v/2)} (1 + \dfrac{t^2}{v})^{-(v+1)/2}$

μ corresponds to the mean of the distribution
    
σ is the scale and corresponds to the standard deviation

ν is the degrees of freedom and takes between 0 and $\infty$. The degrees of freedom corresponds to the number of independent observations minus 1. When the sample size is 8, the t-dsitribution used to model this would have degrees of freedom set to 9. A value of 1 corresponds to the Cauchy distribution and indicates heavy tails, while infinty corresponds to a Normal distribution. 

The mean of the distribution is 0 and the variance is given by ν/(ν - 2).




with pm.Model() as model_t:
    μ = pm.Uniform('μ', 40, 75) # mean
    σ = pm.HalfNormal('σ', sd=10)
    ν = pm.Exponential('ν', 1/30)
    y = pm.StudentT('y', mu=μ, sd=σ, nu=ν, observed=data)
    trace_t = pm.sample(1000)

az.plot_trace(trace_t)
pm.model_to_graphviz(model_t)    

Using a student's t distribution we notice that the outliers are captured more accurately now and the model fits better

# Using a student's t distribution we notice that the outliers are captured more 
# accurately now and the model fits better
y_ppc_t = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(
    trace_t, 100, model_t, random_seed=123)
y_pred_t = az.from_pymc3(trace=trace_t, posterior_predictive=y_ppc_t)
az.plot_ppc(y_pred_t, figsize=(12, 6), mean=True)

### Hierarchical models or Multilevel models

Suppose we want to perform an analysis of water quality in a state and we divide this state into districts, there are two options to do this. We can study each district separately, however we lose information especially if there is insufficient data for some districts. But we get a more detailed model per district.

The second option is to combine all the data and estimate the water quality of the state as a whole. We have more data but we lose granular information about each district.

The hierarchical model combines both of these options, by sharing information between the districts using hyperpriors that are priors over the parameter priors. In other words, instead of setting the parameter priors to a constant value, we draw it from another prior distribution called the hyperprior. This hyperprior is shared among all the districts and as a result sharing information between all the groups in the data.

We measure the water samples for three districts, and we collect 30 samples for each district. We count the number of samples that have contamination below the acceptable levels. We generate two arrays:

* N_samples - The total number of samples collected for each district or group
* G_samples - The number of good samples or samples with contamination levels below a certain threshold
* group_idx - The id for each district or group

#### Artifically generate the data

N_samples = [30, 30, 30] # Total number of samples collected
G_samples = [18, 18, 18] # Number of samples with water contamination 
                         # below accepted levels
# Create an id for each of the 30 + 30 + 30 samples - 0,1,2 to indicate that they
# belong to different groups
group_idx = np.repeat(np.arange(len(N_samples)), N_samples)
data = []
for i in range(0, len(N_samples)):
    data.extend(np.repeat([1, 0], [G_samples[i], N_samples[i]-G_samples[i]]))


group_idx

data

#### The sampling model
This is essentially a binary classification problem that can be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution. The parameter of the Bernoulli distribution is a vector corresponding to each group and indicates the probability of getting a good sample (in each group). Since this is a hierarchical model, each group shares information and a result the parameter of Group 1 can be influenced by the samples in Group 2 and 3. This is what makes hierarchical modeling so powerful. 

The process of generating our samples looks like the following. If we start from the last equation and work our way up, we can see that $\theta_i$ and $y_i$ are similar to a pooled model except that the *Beta* prior takes parameters $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ instead of constant values. These parameters now have hyperpriors applied to them using the parameters $\mu$ and *k* which are assumed to be distributed using a *Beta* distribution and a half Normal distribution respectively. Note that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are indirectly computed from the terms $\mu$ and *k* here.


$ \mu \sim Beta(\alpha_p, \beta_p)  \\
  k \sim | Normal(0,\sigma_k) | \\
  \alpha =  \mu * k \\
  \beta = (1 - \mu) * k \\
  \theta_i \sim Beta(\alpha_i, \beta_i) \\
  y_i \sim Bern(\theta_i)
$



def get_hyperprior_model(data, N_samples, group_idx):
    with pm.Model() as model_h:
        μ = pm.Beta('μ', 1., 1.) # hyperprior
        κ = pm.HalfNormal('κ', 10) # hyperprior
        θ = pm.Beta('θ', alpha=μ*κ, beta=(1.0-μ)*κ, shape=len(N_samples)) # prior
        y = pm.Bernoulli('y', p=θ[group_idx], observed=data)
        trace_h = pm.sample(2000)
    az.plot_trace(trace_h)
    print(az.summary(trace_h))
    return(model_h)    
    
model = get_hyperprior_model(data, N_samples, group_idx)
pm.model_to_graphviz(model)

#### Shrinkage

Shrinkage refers to the phenomenon of sharing information among the groups through the use of hyperpriors. Hierarchical models can therefore be considered partially pooled models since information is shared among the groups so we move away from extremes, which is great if we have outliers (or poor quality data) in our data groups. This is particularly useful if  we do not have a lot of data. Here, the groups are neither independent nor do we clump all the data together without accounting for the differences in the groups. This can 

We can look at three cases below as examples to illustrate what happens here. We keep the total number of samples and the groups the same as before, however we vary the number of good samples in each group. When there are significant differences in the number of good sample between groups, the behavior is different from what we see with an independent model, averages win and extreme values are avoided.

The values of G_samples are changed to have the following values

1. [5,5,5]
2. [18,5,5]
3. [18,18,1]

Note how the values of the three $\theta$s change as we change the values of G_samples.

# Case 1
N_samples = [30, 30, 30] # Total number of samples collected
G_samples = [5, 5, 5] # Number of samples with water contamination

Looking at the plot of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, one can notice the high degree of correlation between these two variables. This results in a parameter posterior space that is diagonally shaped, which is problematic for many samplers such as the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampler. One recommended approach to minimize this correlation is to center the independednt variables.

$\tilde{x} = x - \bar{x}$

The advantage of this is twofold

1. The pivot point is the intercept when the slope changes
2. The parameter posterior space is more circular

In order to center the data

$y = \alpha - \beta x$
can be reformulated as 

$y = \alpha - \tilde{\beta}(x - \bar{x})$ = $\alpha + \tilde{\beta} \bar{x} - \tilde{\beta} x$

$y = \tilde{\alpha} - \tilde{\beta} x$

which implies that the original alpha can now be recovered using the formula

$\alpha = \tilde{\alpha} - \tilde{\beta} \bar{x}$

You can also standardize the data by mean centering and dividing by the standard deviation

$\tilde{x} = (x - \bar{x}) / \sigma_x$

### Hierarchical Linear Regression

In this example, we create 8 subgroups with 7 of them having 20 data points and the last one having a single data point. This is to illustrate the importance of imbalanced subgroups with sparse data. 

The data for the 8 groups are generated from a normal distribution of mean 10 and a standard deviation of 1. The parameters for the linear model are generated from normal and beta distributions.

M = 8

### Logistic Regression

While everything we have seen so far involved regression, the same ideas can be applied to a classification task as well. We use the logistic regression model to perform this classification here. The name 'regression' is due to the fact that the model outputs class probabilities as numbers which is then converted into classes using a decision boundary. There are many ways to select an appropriate decision boundary, many of which is covered in the section for model selection.

#### Inverse Link function

At this point it is a good idea to bring up the concept of a inverse link function, which takes the form

$\theta = f(\alpha + \beta x)$

Here 'f' is called the inverse link function, the term inverse refers to the fact that the function is applied to the right hand side of the equation. In a linear regression, this inverse link function is the identity function. In the case of a lienar regression model, the value 'y' at any point 'x' is modeled as the mean of a Gaussian distribution centered at the point (x,y). The error as a result of the true 'y' and the estimated 'y' as modeled with the standard deviation of this Gaussian at that point (x,y). Now think about the scenario where this is not appropriately modeled using a Gaussian. A classification problem is a perfect example of such a scenario where the discrete classes are not modeled well as a Gaussian and hence we can't use a Gaussian to model the mean of those classes. As a result, we would like to convert the output of $\alpha = \beta x$ to some other range of values that are more appropriate to the distribution being modeled, which is what the link function intends to do.

#### Logistic function

The logistic function is defined as the function

$logistic(x) = \dfrac{1}{1 + \exp{(-x)}}$

This is also called the sigmoid function and it restricts value to the range [0,1]

x = np.linspace(-5,5)
plt.plot(x, 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)))
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('logistic(x)')



#### Example using the Iris data

The simplest example using a logistic regression model is one that can be used to identify two classes. If you are given a set of independent variables that are features which correspond to an output dependent variable that is a class, you can build a model to learn the relationship between the features and the output classes. This is done with the help of the logistic function which acts as the inverse link function to relate the features to the output class. 

$\theta = logistic(\alpha + \beta x)$

$y = Bern(\theta)$

Here the binary class probability is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, but the mean parameter $\theta$ is now given by the regression equation $logistic(\alpha + \beta x)$. In regular linear regression, this parameter was drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Also, in the case of the coin-flip example where we use a Bernoulli distribution, the parameter $\theta$ was drawn from a Beta prior distribution however here we have output classes associated with every observation and hence can be posed as a regression problem.

We load the iris data from scikit learn and plot the distribution of the three classes for two of the features. We also perform a pairplot to visualize the correlation of each feature with every other feature. The diagonal of this plot shows the distribution of the three classes for that feature.


import pymc3 as pm
import sklearn
import numpy as np
import graphviz
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn
from sklearn import datasets
df = datasets.load_iris()
iris_data = pd.DataFrame(df['data'], columns=df['feature_names'])
iris_data['target'] = df['target']
seaborn.stripplot(x='target', y='sepal length (cm)', data=iris_data, jitter=False)
plt.figure()
seaborn.stripplot(x='target', y='petal length (cm)', data=iris_data, jitter=False)
plt.figure()
seaborn.pairplot(iris_data, hue='target', diag_kind='kde')
plt.figure()
corr = iris_data.query("target == (0,1)").loc[:, iris_data.columns != 'target'].corr() 
mask = np.tri(*corr.shape).T 
seaborn.heatmap(corr.abs(), mask=mask, annot=True)
plt.show()

You would notice that some of the variables have a high degree of correlation from the correlation plot. One approach is to eliminate one of the correlated variables. The second option is to mean-center and use a weakly-informative prior such as a Students t-distribution for all variables that are not binary. The scale parameter can be adjusted for the range of expected values for these variables and the normality parameter is recommended to be between 3 and 7. (Source: Andrew Gelman and the Stan team)



df['target_names']

# Select the first two classes for a binary classification problem
df = iris_data.query("target == (0,1)")
y_0 = df.target
x_n = 'sepal length (cm)' 
x_0 = df[x_n].values
x_c = x_0 - x_0.mean()


import pymc3 as pm
import arviz as az

with pm.Model() as model_0:
    α = pm.Normal('α', mu=0, sd=10)
    β = pm.Normal('β', mu=0, sd=10)
    μ = α + pm.math.dot(x_c, β)    
    θ = pm.Deterministic('θ', pm.math.sigmoid(μ))
    bd = pm.Deterministic('bd', -α/β)
    yl = pm.Bernoulli('yl', p=θ, observed=y_0)
    trace_0 = pm.sample(1000)

pm.model_to_graphviz(model_0)

az.summary(trace_0, var_names=["α","β","bd"])

theta = trace_0['θ'].mean(axis=0)
idx = np.argsort(x_c)
plt.plot(x_c[idx], theta[idx], color='C2', lw=3)
plt.vlines(trace_0['bd'].mean(), 0, 1, color='k')
bd_hpd = az.hpd(trace_0['bd'])
plt.fill_betweenx([0, 1], bd_hpd[0], bd_hpd[1], color='k', alpha=0.5)
plt.scatter(x_c, np.random.normal(y_0, 0.02),
            marker='.', color=[f'C{x}' for x in y_0])
az.plot_hpd(x_c, trace_0['θ'], color='C2')
plt.xlabel(x_n)
plt.ylabel('θ', rotation=0)
# use original scale for xticks
locs, _ = plt.xticks()
plt.xticks(locs, np.round(locs + x_0.mean(), 1))

In this case, the decision boundary is defined to be the value of 'x' when 'y' = 0.5. This turns out to be $-\alpha / \beta$. However, this value was chosen under the assumption that the midpoint of the class values are a good candidate, but this does not have to be the case.

#### Multiple Logistic Regression

The above example with a single feature can be expanded to take multiple features or independent variables.

# Select the first two classes for a binary classification problem
df = iris_data.query("target == (0,1)")
y_0 = df.target
x_n = ['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)']
# Center the data by subtracting the mean from both columns
df_c = df - df.mean() 
x_c = df_c[x_n].values
print(x_c)


As we saw before, the equation for multiple logistic regression relating the $\theta$ parameter to the features can be written as 

$\theta = logistic(\alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2)$

$y = Bern(\theta)$

This gives us a decision boundary, assuming y = 0.5, of 

$x = -\dfrac{\alpha}{\beta_2} - \dfrac{\beta_1}{\beta_2} x_1$ 

Unlike the previous equation, this one represents a line for the variables x1 and x2 which separates the two-dimensional space occupied by x1 and x2. For higher dimensions, this boundary decision will be a hyperplane of dimension 'n-1' for a feature space of dimension 'n'.

    α = pm.Normal('α', mu=0, sd=10)

    μ = α + pm.math.dot(x_c, β) 
    θ = pm.Deterministic('θ', 1 / (1 + pm.math.exp(-μ))) 
    bd = pm.Deterministic('bd', -α/β[1] - β[0]/β[1] * x_c[:,0])
    yl = pm.Bernoulli('yl', p=θ, observed=y_0) 
    trace_0 = pm.sample(2000)


# We plot the HPD on the centered data, we have not scaled it back to the original range
idx = np.argsort(x_c[:,0]) 
bd = trace_0['bd'].mean(0)[idx] 
plt.scatter(x_c[:,0], x_c[:,1], c=[f'C{x}' for x in y_0]) 
plt.plot(x_c[:,0][idx], bd, color='k');

### Multiclass Classification

For a multiclass problem, one uses the softmax function instead of the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is a special case of the softmax for a two-class classification problem. The softmax can be written as

$ softmax(x_i) = \dfrac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_k \exp(x_k)} $

We also used a Bernoulli distribution for our $\theta$ parameter, however now we have a categorical distribution.

$\theta = logistic(\alpha + \beta x)$

$y = Categorical(\theta)$

#### Logistic regression example for a multiclass problem 

We reuse the previous example, however we are going to use all the three classes in the data here along with all the features for maximum separability. The data is also standardized instead of just mean-centered here.

### Poisson Distribution

Discrete variables that represents count data can be handled using a Poisson distribution. The key element here is that it is the number of events happening in a given interval of time. The events are supposed to be independent and is parameterized using one value called the rate parameter. This corresponds to the mean and the variance of the distribution. One implication of this is that the higher the mean, the larger the variance of the distribution which can be limitation for some phenomena. A higher value of the rate parameter indicates a higher likelihood of getting higher values from our distribution. It is represented by

$f(x) = e^{-\mu} \mu^x / x!$

The mean rate is represented by $\mu$ and x is positive integer that represents the number of events that can happen. If you recall from the discussion of the binomial distribution, that can also be used to model the probability of the number of successes out of 'n' trials. The Poisson distribution is a special case of this binomial distribution and is used when the trials far exceed the number of successes. 

#### Poisson Distribution Example

In the following example we look at a time-varying rate phenomena, consider the observations as the number of COVID-19 cases per day. We observe cases for 140 days, however due to some interventional measures put in place it is suspected that the number of cases per day have gone down. If we assume that the number of cases can be modeled using a Poisson distribution then this implies that there are two rates $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ and we can try to find where this rate-switch happens (time $\tau$). 

We don't really know a lot about these rates, so we select a prior for both which can be from an Exponential, Gamma or Uniform distributions. Both Exponential and Gamma distributions work better than the Uniform distribution since the Uniform distribution is the least informative. As usual, with enough observations one can even get away with a Uniform prior. Since we have no information regarding $\tau$, we select a Uniform prior distribution for that.

Try varying the following

1. types of priors - a more informed prior is always better if this information is available
2. the size of the data or the observations and the value of the theta parameter - more data results in better inference overall, the larger the difference in theta the easier to determine these rates
3. the number of drawn samples - better and more accurate inference
4. the number of chains - should reduce variance
5. the number of cores - cores should be no more than the total number of chains and should be limited to the total number of cores on your hardware, you should see an increase in speed or decrease in runtime as you increase the number of cores.

### Diagnosing MCMC using PyMC3

It is a good idea to inspect the quality of the solutions obtained. It is possible once obtains suboptimal samples resulting in biased estimates or the sampling is slow. There are two broad categories of tests, a visual inspection and a quantitative assessment. Several things that can be done if one suspects issues.

1. More samples, it is possible that there aren't samples to come up with an appropriate posterior
2. Use burn-in, this is removing a certain number of samples from the beginning while PyMC3 is figuring out the step size. This is set to 500 by default. With tuning it is not necessary to explicitly get rid of samples from the beginning.
3. Increase the number of samples used for tuning.
4. Increase the target_accept parameter as 
    `pm.sample(5000, chains=2, target_accept=0.95)`
    
    `pm.sample(5000, chains=2, nuts_kwargs=dict(target_accept=0.95))`
    
    Target_accept is the acceptance probability of the samples. This has the effect of varying the step size in the MCMC process so that we get the desired acceptance probability as indicated by the value to target_accept. It is a good idea to take smaller steps especially during Hamiltonian Monte Carlo so as to explore regions of high curvature better. (See below section on tuning)
5. Reparameterize the model so that the model while remaining the same, is expressed differently so that is easier to explore the space and find solutions.
6. Modify the data representation - mean centering and standardizing the data are two standard techniques that can be applied here. Note that (5) refers to model transformation while this is specifically modifying the data.

#### Tuning

[Colin Caroll's talk](https://colcarroll.github.io/hmc_tuning_talk/)

When a step size is required, PyMC3 uses the first 500 steps varying the step size to get to an acceptance rate of 23.4%. These are the default numbers that PyMC3 uses, which can be modified. It was reported in a study that the acceptance rate of 23.4% results in the highest efficiency for Metropolis Hastings. These are empirical results and therefore should be treated as guidelines. According to the SAS Institute, a high acceptance rate (90% or so) usually is a sign that the new samples are being drawn from points close to the existing point and therefore the sampler is not exploring the space much. On the other hand, a low acceptance rate is probably due to inappropriate proposal distribution causing new samples to be rejected. PyMC3 aims to get an acceptance rate between 20% and 50% for Metropolis Hastings, 65% for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and 85% for No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)

If you have convergence issues as indicated by the visual inspection of the trace, you can try increasing the number of samples used for tuning. It is also worth pointing out that there is more than just step-size adaptation that is happening during this tuning phase. 

`pm.sample(num_samples, n_tune=num_tuning)`

##### Metropolis algorithm
In the Metropolis algorithm the standard deviation of the proposal distribution is a tuning parameter that can be set while initializing the algorithm. 

$x_{t+1} \sim Normal(x_t, stepsize \cdot I)$

The larger this value, the larger the space from where new samples can be drawn. If the acceptance rate is too high, increase this standard deviation. Keep in mind that you run the risk of getting invalid draws if it is too large. 

##### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm

The HMC algorithm is based on the solution of differential equations known as Hamilton's equations. These differential equations depend on the probability distributions we are trying to learn. We navigate these distributions by moving around them in a trajectory using steps that are defined by a position and momentum at that position. Navigating these trajectories can be a very expensive process and the goal is to minimize this computational process.

To get a sense of the intuition behind HMC, it is based on the notion of conservation of energy. When the sampler trajectory is far away from the probability mass center, it has high potential energy but low kinetic energy and when it is closer to the center of the probability mass will have high kinetic energy but low potential energy.

The step size, in HMC, corresponds to the covariance of the momentum distribution that is sampled. Smaller step sizes move slowly in the manifold however larger step sizes can result in integration errors. There is a Metropolis step at the end of the HMC algorithm and and as a result the corresponding target acceptance rates of 65% in PyMC3.

#### Mixing 

Mixing refers to how well the sampler covers the 'support' of the posterior distribution or rather how well it covers the entire distribution. Poor convergence is often a result of poor mixing. This can happen due the choice of 
1. inappropriate proposal distribution for Metropolis 
2. if we have too many correlated variables

The underlying cause for this can be
1. too large a step size to be able to escape a region of high curvature
2. multimodal distributions 


#### Diagnostic statistics

We can compute a metric called Rhat (also called the potential scale reduction factor) that measures the variance between the chains with the variance within the chains. It is calculated as the standard deviation using the samples from all the chains (all samples appended together from each chain) over the  RMS of the within-chain standard deviations of all the chains. Poorly mixed samples will have greater variance in the accumulated samples (numerator) compared to the variance in the individual chains. It was empirically accepted that Rhat values below 1.1 are considered acceptable while those above it are indications of a lack of convergence in the chains. Gelman et al. (2013) introduced a split Rhat that compares the first half with the second half of the samples from each chain to improve upon the regular Rhat. Arviz implements a split Rhat as can be seen from [Arviz Rhat](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/generated/arviz.rhat.html), along an improved rank-based Rhat
[Improved Rhat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08008.pdf).

`az.rhat(trace, method='split')`

#### Centered vs. Non-centered parameterization

This is a centered parameterization for $\beta$ since it is centered around $\mu$

$\beta \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$

We try to fit the two parameters for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ directly

However, this is a non-centered parameterization since it is scaled from a unit Normal

$\beta_{unit} \sim Normal(0,1)$

$\beta = \mu + \sigma \beta_{unit}$

#### Convergence

Using the example of the centered (cm) and non-centered models (ncm) we can differentiate between models that exhibit good convergence behavior and those that do not.

print("Starting centered model, direct fit")
with pm.Model() as centered_model:
    a = pm.HalfNormal('a', 5)
    b = pm.Normal('b', 0, a, shape=5)
    trace_cm = pm.sample(2000, random_seed=7)
    
print("Starting non-centered model, shifted and scaled model")
with pm.Model() as non_centered_model:
    a = pm.HalfNormal('a', 5)
    b_standard = pm.Normal('b_standard', mu=0, sd=1, shape=5)
    b = pm.Deterministic('b', 0 + b_standard * a)
    trace_ncm = pm.sample(2000, random_seed=7)

print("------------ Centered model ------------")

# The bars indicate the location of the divergences in the sampling process
az.plot_trace(trace_cm, divergences='bottom')
az.summary(trace_cm)

print("------------ Non-centered model ------------")

# The bars indicate the locations of divergences in the sampling process
az.plot_trace(trace_ncm, divergences='top')
az.summary(trace_ncm)

1. The KDE has more agreement for the non-centered model(ncm) compared to the centered model (cm) for the different chains.
2. There are more divergences for cm compared to the ncm as can be seen from the vertical bars in the trace plot. 
3. In general, ncm mixes better than cm - ncm looks like evenly mixed while cm looks patchy in certain regions. 
4. It is possible to see flat lines in the trace, a flat indicates that the same sample value is being used because all new proposed samples are being rejected, in other words the sampler is samping slowly and not getting to a different space in the manifold. The only fix here is to sample for longer periods of time, however we are assuming we can get more unbiased samples if we let it run for longer.

# We plot the densities of both the cm and the ncm models, notice the differences in effective sample sizes for
# the cm (very low)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1,3)
fig.set_size_inches(18.5, 10.5)
az.plot_forest([trace_cm, trace_ncm], var_names=['a'], 
               kind = 'ridgeplot',
               model_names=['Centered','Non-centered'],
               combined=False, 
               ess=True, 
               r_hat=True, 
               ax=axs[0:3], 
               figsize=(20,20) )
#az.plot_forest(trace_ncm, var_names=['a'],
#               kind='ridgeplot',
#               combined=False, 
#               ess=True, 
#               r_hat=True, 
#               ax=axs[1,0:3])

#### Autocorrelation and effective sample sizes

Ideally, we would like to have zero correlation in the samples that are drawn. Correlated samples violate our condition of independence and can give us biased posterior estimates of our posterior distribution. 
Thinning or pruning refers to the process of dropping every nth sample from a chain. This is to minimize the number of correlated samples that might be drawn, especially if the proposal distribution is narrow. The autocorrelation plot computes the correlation of a sequence with itself but shifted by n, for each n on the x axis the corresponding value of autocorrelation is plotted on the y axis.  

`az.plot_autocorr(trace, var_names=["a", "b"])`

Techniques like Metropolis-Hastings are susceptible to having auto-correlated samples. We plot the autcorrelation here for the cm and the ncm models. The cm models have samples that have a high degree of autocorrelation while the ncm models does not.

fig, axs = plt.subplots(4,2)
fig.set_size_inches(15, 15)
az.plot_autocorr(trace_cm, var_names=['a'], ax=axs[0:4,0])
az.plot_autocorr(trace_ncm, var_names=['a'], ax=axs[0:4,1])

Since a chain with autocorrelation has fewer samples that are independent, we can calculate the number of effective samples called the effective sample size. This is listed during when a summary of the trace is printed out, however it can also be explicitly computed using

`az.efective_n(trace_s)`

PyMC3 will throw a warning if the number of effective samples is less than 200 (200 is heuristically determined to provide a good approximation for the mean of a distribution). Unless you want to sample from the tails of a distribution (rare events), 1000 to 2000 samples should provide a good approximation for a distribution.

#### Monte Carlo error 

The Monte Carlo error is a measure of the error of our sampler which stems from the fact that not all samples that we have drawn are independent. This error is defined by dividing a trace into n blocks. We then compute the mean of these blocks and calculate the error as the standard deviation of these means over the square root of the number of blocks.

$mc_{error} = \sigma(\mu(block_i)) / \sqrt(n)$


#### Divergence

Divergences happen in regions of high curvature in the manifold. When PyMC3 detects a divergence it abandons that chain and as a result the samples that are reported to have been diverging are close to the space of high curvature but not necessarily right on it.

In some cases, PyMC3 can indicate falsely that some samples are divergences, this is due to the heuristics used to identify divergences. Concentration of samples in a region is an indication that these are not divergences. 

We visualize this for the cm and ncm models with pairplots of the variables. You can see how the cm models have difficulty sampling at the edge of the funnel shaped two-dimensional manifold formed by the pairplot. This is a result of the sharp discontinuity where the sampler is having difficulty sampling. 

# Get the divergences
print("Number of divergences %d and percent %lf " % (trace_cm['diverging'].nonzero()[0].shape[0], trace_cm['diverging'].nonzero()[0].shape[0]/ len(trace_cm) * 100))
divergent = trace_cm['diverging']

print("Number of divergences %d and percent %lf " % (trace_ncm['diverging'].nonzero()[0].shape[0], trace_ncm['diverging'].nonzero()[0].shape[0]/ len(trace_ncm) * 100))
divergent = trace_cm['diverging']

az.plot_pair(trace_cm, var_names = ['a', 'b'], divergences=True)
az.plot_pair(trace_ncm, var_names = ['a', 'b'], divergences=True)

az.plot_pair(trace_cm, var_names = ['a', 'b'], coords={'b_dim_0': [0]}, kind='scatter', divergences=True)
az.plot_pair(trace_ncm, var_names = ['a', 'b'], coords={'b_dim_0': [0]}, kind='scatter', divergences=True)

You can also have a parallel coordinates plot of the variables to look at the multidimensional data instead of pairplots. If we notice tight-knit lines around a region, that is an indication of diffculty sampling and hence divergences. This behavior can be observed in cm around 0 while ncm has a sparser cluster of lines around 0. Sparser clusters can be an indication of false positives where divergences are reported. The three ways to avoid the problem of divergences, two of which are changing the parameters passed to PyMC3 and one involves changing how we formulate the problem

1. Increase the tuning samples
2. Increase 'target_accept'

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2,1)
fig.set_size_inches(20,20)
axs[0].set_title('CM model')
axs[1].set_title('NCM model')
az.plot_parallel(trace_cm, var_names=['a','b'], figsize=(20,20), shadend=0.01, colord='tab:blue', textsize=15, ax=axs[0])
az.plot_parallel(trace_ncm, var_names=['a','b'], figsize=(20,20), shadend=0.01, colord='tab:blue', textsize=15,ax=axs[1])

#### A note on why we compute the log of the posterior

In short, this is done to avoid numerical overflow or underflow issues. When dealing with really large or small numbers, it is likely the limited precision of storage types (float, double etc.) can be an issue. In order to avoid this, the log of the probabilities are used instead in the calculations.

### Arviz data representation

From the Arviz page, it states that, apart from NumPy arrays and Python dictionaries, there is support for a few data structures such as xarrays, InferenceData and NetCDF. While NumPy and dictionaries are great for in-memory computations, the other file formats are suitable for persisting computed data and models to disk. InferenceData is a high-level data structure that holds the data in a storage format such as NetCDF.
